          What does homemade mean to you? Is it something you cook or make for
          your family or the time with family or smells that build the memories?
          When I started this homemade baking business in April of 2012, it was
          with the idea that everything would be made from scratch. Mainly
          because of my own memories in the kitchen of cooking with my family.
          Coming from a big family, everything was made from scratch so never in
          a million years did I imagined how much fun I was going to have baking
          for my community. When I say baked from scratch, I mean that I use
          basic ingredients from start to finish. I make buttercream frosting
          with real butter and our custom cakes, cinnamon rolls, and cookies
          made completely from scratch with farm-fresh local eggs and real
          butter. If you have questions about any ingredient please feel free to
          ask.I hope you have some great memories of homemade baked goods, where
          the scent of fresh-baked bread or chocolate chip cookies came from a
          kitchen with people who loved and cared about you. This is where
          homemade becomes a beautiful description of a place in time that we
          felt loved, or even safe. If you were lucky enough to experience this
          with someone special, then you know what I’m talking about. I hope
          that you feel that way with every order you receive from Angela’s
          Bakery.

      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <span
        >We bake the best cakes with love and passion.First just a little bite
        about Angela’s Bakery. We are located in the beautiful town of Quincy
        California. Angela’s Bakery opened in 2013 with a goal to create
        delicious custom baked goods. Our passion is to provide the most
        flavor-filled, baked from scratch products for our friends in Plumas
        County. We are a BY APPOINTMENT only bakery. Our bakery is NOT a retail
        location. Please use the contact form to make an appointment or place an
        order. We aim for perfection, safety, and delicious in all that we
        create. Please fill out a contact form and let’s get your date on the
        calendar because the bakery schedule fills up fast. The sooner you book
        your order the better chance you have of getting on our schedule. Please
        allow 48 hours for small orders and 1 week of notice for large
        events.Everything on the menu is made and baked in our fully certified
        home kitchen. This is made possible under the California Cottage Food
        Act. Our kitchen is custom designed to bake for you! Over the years we
        have acquired the tools necessary to bake for larger events. Since March
        of 2020, our events became smaller and more personal. Wedding cakes for
        example were smaller but they are beautiful and show the style of the
        wedding. For our customer’s peace of mind, we offer individually
        packaging for cupcakes and cookies. Please let us know when you order if
        individual packaging is what you prefer. It is truly a delight to create
        beautiful and delicious wedding cakes. Everyday should be celebrated
        with beautiful deserts. As the 2022 wedding and event season is in full
        swing we are seeing caution and larger attendance. Our commitment to
        safety of the product we deliver remains unchanged. Anything we can do
        to add to your peace of mind.Meet the Baker, Angela Sandlin. She is the
        oldest in a family of 6 kids. A farm girl from a small family-run dairy
        farm in Northern Utah, just outside of Logan. This farm girl helped milk
        small herd of dairy cows, tend a large garden, and participated in
        raising 4-H animals like turkeys, sheep, and rabbits. Life was filled
        with milking, taking care of animals, canning food for the winter, and
        hauling hay. The family garden, grandparent’s orchard and animals grown
        on the farm provided a lot of the family’s food for the winter. Baking
        from scratch was just part of growing up in a big family. Angela has 6
        kids of her own and has lived in the beautiful town of Quincy California
        since 2008.</span
